# Installation

##Blender##
I currently use [blender](https://www.blender.org/download/)'s long term support version 2.83.9 (on linux) spcifically the tgz download, unpack and therein start blender. This allows me to use different versions in parallel (just in cas).

##BlenderCam##
In order to be able to use [blendercam](https://github.com/vilemduha/blendercam) follow the [documentation](https://github.com/vilemduha/blendercam/wiki).
I might later on add some notes here.
