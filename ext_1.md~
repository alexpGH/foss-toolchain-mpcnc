# Extending the part from tutorial 1

## Sensible settings & ramp in dressup

We'll do the following:
- use a higher feed (as we are milling xps)
- use a step over of 25% of toll diameter
- adapt the step down 2.5mm to get the full depth at 2 passes (actually not necessary for xps
- add a path *dressup* which adds a ramp to the plunging into the material
