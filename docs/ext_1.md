# Sensible settings & ramp in dressup

We'll do the following:

- use a higher feed (as we are milling xps)
- use a step over of 25% of tool diameter
- adapt the step down 2.5mm to get the full depth at 2 passes (actually not necessary for xps
- add a path *dressup* which adds a ramp to the plunging into the material

# Finishing passes & holding tags

We'll do the following:

- add a finishing pass to the pocket inner contour, based on the edges
- add a finishing pass to the island contour based on the face
- add a holding tag dressup to the island countour pass

For the passes I use climb milling (setting *ccw*).<br>

Sliptonic has great Freecad videos. [Regarding holding tag dressup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZ4prlR6sps).

We did not cover how to set the starting point for the path. I f you need it, have a look at sliponics [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1ezXIaOw60)
