# What is this
This are some early thoughts and design for a simple to build (easy to replace) sailplane for slope soaring. With simple to build I mean simple when you have access to a cnc milling machine for milling foam.


# Wing outline
The outline should be based on the elliptic planar wing basis. Having access to cnc milling, the straight outlines of the Swift or Kobutz are not required.
<br>We can make use of more organic-like and more efficient (regarding induced drag) shapes like the stingray. You have some spare time? Read [Epplers great paper on induced drag and winglets](https://journals.sfu.ca/ts/index.php/ts/article/download/524/495).

How do we achieve this?
<br>First, we import an image of the said geometry in blender. I used the outline provided at [Rc-Network](https://www.rc-network.de/threads/stingray-profilfrage.173616/).

Import the image: add > Image > as background and place it.
