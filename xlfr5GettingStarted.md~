# XLFR5

## Installation

I build the main repo of André (the author of xflr5, aka *techwinder*).
In case of problems you can also try to build the [ubuntu specific patched version](https://github.com/polmes/xflr5-ubuntu).

```
svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/xflr5/code/trunk xflr5-code
```


Install prerequisites
```
apt-get install build-essential mesa-common-dev mesa-utils libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev qt5-qmake libqt5opengl5-dev
```


Building
<br>Note: I initially had an error:
> cd xflr5-engine/ && ( test -e Makefile || /usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmake -o Makefile /home/alexp/wicht_soft/xflr5-code/xflr5/xflr5-engine/xflr5-engine.pro ) && make -f Makefile 
> Project ERROR: Unknown module(s) in QT: core gui
> make: *** [Makefile:49: sub-xflr5-engine-make_first] Error 3

Seems to have been fixed by installing libqt5opengl5-dev

```
cd xflr5-code/xflr5
qmake
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```
Finally, start xlfr5
```
xlfr5
```

## Tutorial notes
I followed the [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7saOcozpi8&list=PLtl5ylS6jdP6uOxzSJKPnUsvMbkmalfKg) of André (the developer of xlfr5 aka techwinder). The following notes are only meant as comments to the tutorials.
