# Motivation for using Blender

After my initial tests with FreeCad, I opted for [blender](https://www.blender.org/) and the great [blendercam](https://github.com/vilemduha/blendercam) for design and gCode generation for complex parts (like airfoils).

The main reason is that I usually build 3d sphapes like surfboards, airfoils and wings for hydrofoils, which I construct script based. Blender is great for this. I might add some more details about my approach in this section.

**Some examples:**

The following 3 pictures show 1/4 of a SUP board foam core with heavily milled-away foam in the inner. The holes go 'down' to 10mm distnace from the surface.

The follwoing picture shows 1/2 of an airfoil including the calculated milling path for coarse milling.
